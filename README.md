## Environment Setup

To set up the environment, first you need create .env file (you can use .env.example for this)

Next, you need to install the required gems specified in the `Gemfile`. Here's a summary of notable gems used:

### Core Gems

- **Rails**: Version 7.2
- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the database.
- **Puma**: Web server.
- **Devise**: For user authentication.
- **Pundit**: For authorization.
- **Rolify**: To manage user roles.

### Development & Testing Gems

- **RSpec**: For testing.
- **FactoryBot**: For creating test data.
- **Faker**: For generating fake data.
- **Rubocop**: Code style checker.

### Additional Gems

- **WillPaginate**: Pagination for articles.
- **RailsAdmin**: Admin panel interface.
- **JSONAPI::Serializer**: Serializer for API responses.

Install all dependencies by running:

```bash
bundle install
```

Set up the database:

## API Endpoints

### Articles

The API uses `JSONAPI::Serializer` to format responses.

Example response:

{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "article",
      "attributes": {
        "title": "Sample Title",
        "body": "Sample body text.",
        "status": "public",
        "likes": 5,
        "author": {
          "id": 1,
          "email": "user@example.com"
        },
        "comments": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "body": "Great post!",
            "likes": 2,
            "user": {
              "id": 2,
              "email": "commenter@example.com"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
